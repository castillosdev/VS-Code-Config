Welcome to my distraction-free VS Code configuration! In this setup, I've carefully curated settings to make your coding experience more enjoyable and less distracting. The primary goal is to optimize the interface, enhance scrolling and cursor behavior, and introduce good keybindings. 



Additionally, I've included some extensions that I personally find useful for development.

1. **Reducing Distractions:**
To make VS Code less distracting, I've customized the theme and user interface to have a clean and minimalistic appearance. We'll use a light or dark theme with muted colors, which helps reduce eye strain and minimizes distractions while you code.

2. **Smooth Cursor and Scrolling:**
A smooth and responsive cursor is essential for a seamless coding experience. I've fine-tuned the cursor blink rate and added settings to ensure that scrolling through code is smooth and effortless.

3. **Intuitive Keybindings:**
Intuitive keybindings can significantly improve your coding speed and efficiency. I've remapped some default keybindings and introduced custom ones to help you navigate, search, and perform common tasks with ease.

4. **Extensions for Development:**
Extensions are powerful tools that can enhance your coding capabilities. I've included some of my favorite extensions for various programming languages, code linting, formatting, and debugging. These extensions will streamline your development workflow and provide helpful insights.

Please remember that these settings are not set in stone. Feel free to tweak them to better suit your personal preferences and workflow. VS Code is highly customizable, and everyone's ideal setup may differ. Don't hesitate to experiment and improve these settings as you see fit.

If you have any suggestions or additional settings that you believe can contribute to a more distraction-free and productive coding environment, don't hesitate to share them! Happy coding!
